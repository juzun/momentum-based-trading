    "## Introduction to the Project\n",
    "The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market and economy. Over the long term, the S&P 500 has shown consistent growth, making it a key focus for long-term investors. However, it can also experience significant volatility in the short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will make our first attempt to build a momentum-based strategy to trade the S&P 500 index. At the end of the project, you will have built a program that you can later expand and customise to suit your needs. We will use the python packages numpy, scipy and sqlite3, among others, in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips: Review the code snippets that we went through during the course. Reorganize them and you are half-way done! Try experimenting with different configurations of the confidence interval, the lookback window and the forecast horizon. Be brave and experiment with different ways of deciding the position size. You may be surprised by your talent!"

    "<b>confidence</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Wider interval causes more conservative approach, which on several attempts produces better results. Value of just 10 % is too low, total wealth at the end was almost always 0. Funny (obvious) thing - setting it to 0.99 copies the SP500 profile and it's actually the most stable profitable long-term strategy. However, it will certainly not bring us to multiplication of initial wealth, unlike higher risk with narrower confidence interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "Minimum trade size is there to avoid excessive trading costs from frequent small trades (not implemented, but potentially useful). Also avoids too eager trading behavior in this simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>risk_sizing</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk sizing means the percentage we are willing to risk from our total capital on a single trade. Lower values - more conservative trading. Initiall 5 % seemed to high to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>lookback</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower lookback number eans we consider less history for our calibration. It's worth trying to shorten it to catch more volatility in the medium/short term.\n",
